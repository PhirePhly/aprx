		     APRX   0.15

		  	TODO

- configure -script ?

- manual (man-pages exist)

- "make install"
  - Sort of one exists..

- system integration bits, like init-scripts..
  - Debian Linux
  - Fedora Linux
  - ...

- bidirectional relaying capability with areal filters ??
  (that would make this a full-blown aprsd / aprsdigi replacement..)

- aprx-stat  tool:
  - exists for extracting data out of erlang datasets
  - need to improve its output formats ?
  - possibly to run suid-root ?
