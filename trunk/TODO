		     APRX   0.99

		  	TODO

- system integration bits, like init-scripts..
  - Debian Linux
  - Fedora Linux
  - ...

- Proper SMACK support on serial port.
  Receiving SMACK is fine, but proper way to ENABLE it at TNC
  is to send at first a small DATA packet with properly formatted
  header byte, and embedded CRC.
     -- experimental code done on 2008-Oct-28

- OpenTRAC support ?  (UI, PID=0x77)

- "radio NN ... KISS .." to support multiple TNCs,
   and more esoteric polling modes

- AGWPE interface for Windows ?

- bidirectional relaying capability with areal filters ??
  (that would make this a full-blown aprsd / aprsdigi replacement..)
