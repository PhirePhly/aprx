		     APRX   v0.11

		  	TODO

- config file reading
   - Mostly done

- manual (man-pages exist)

- configure -script

- "make install"
  - Sort of one exists..

- bidirectional relaying capability with areal filters ??
  (that would make this a full-blown aprsd / aprsdigi replacement..)

- aprx-stat  tool:
  - exists for extracting data out of erlang datasets
  - need to improve its output formats ?
  - possibly to run suid-root ?

- Properly process heard RF 3rd-party packets
   - Discard them all ?  (CURRENT BEHAVIOUR)
     ( http://www.aprs-is.net/ISPaths.htm )
   - Open up 3rd party header, and check if gating is OK ?
