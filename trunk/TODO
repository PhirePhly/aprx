		     APRX   1.03

		  	TODO

- system integration bits, like init-scripts..
  - Debian Linux
  - Fedora Linux
  - ...

- OpenTRAC support ?  (UI, PID=0x77)
  - No.  Entirely different protocol.

- "radio NN ... KISS .." to support more esoteric polling modes

- AGWPE interface for Windows ?

- bidirectional relaying capability with areal filters ??
  (that would make this a full-blown aprsd / aprsdigi replacement..)
