				 APRX   1.99

				TODO / Wishlist

- Shrink memory consumption @ Erlang datasets.
  When there is no backing storage, always use small datasets,
  and when there is active backing storage, use larger one.
  Make the aprx.state file name to be non-defaulted.
  When configuration does not define it, not do not use backing storage.

- Tx-IGate filter rules (interface.c)
  Tx-IGate is lacking following things, but it is already doing
  most important ones ('recipient heard recently in my service area')
   - detect igates heard from RF, and log them on X (historydb?)
   - figure out (at parse_aprs() ?) the number of hops a packet has
     traversed so far, and log that on historydb (for recipient "locality"
     analysis)
   - test that message recipients known coordinates are within
     "my service area" 
      -->  separate filter from adjunct-style areas or distances?
   - Arrived-via-internet tests (IGates on RF and unclear rules via APRSIS))
   - for position-less packets, send at first a position packet for same
      source callsign, if available


- digipeater behaviour on "requested wideness exceeds allowed
  max limit" and this is a directly heard packet:
   - now mark all H-bits set
   - ADDITION: inject transmitter callsign into first VIA slot.

- Digipeating details of non-APRS UI protocols?  Some way to
  handle "WIDEn-N" on selected PIDs?
- OpenTRAC support ?  (UI, PID=0x77)
  - Yes, on DIGIPEATER ONLY - what about WIDEn-N ? Y/N ?

- "<interface> serial-device ... KISS .." to support more
  esoteric polling modes

- Windows port?
  - AGWPE interface for Windows ?
  - BPQ32 interface ?

- Colorize debug printout (or make another tool to colorize aprx-rf.log)
    - rx-packets green (or blue), tx-packets red
    - port names/callsigns bolded, same with packet source callsigns

- Use internal APRS packet parser to validate beacon configurations.
  This should be able to flag bad input on RAW beacon data.

- Calculate and note APRS DXes (like digi_ned does) ?
- Calculate ALOHA range, and publish it?


BoB:
	Shucks, it would sure be nice if EVERY DIGIPEATER also had a
	little smarts and could also report on its own RSSI.

	That would give some people a clue what the digipeater is
	hearing on its input.  In its 10 minute beacon it could report:

		"176RX, 109TX, 243 busy"

	ON a ten minute basis (total 600 1 sec slots) this tells us that
	176 packets were decoded at this site, 109 were elegible for
	further digipeating, and another 243 seconds the channel was
	busy with other collisions and non decodable traffic.  Leaving
	72 secnds the channel was clear.
