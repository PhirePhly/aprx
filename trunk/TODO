				 APRX   1.96

				TODO / Wishlist

- system integration bits, like init-scripts..
  - Debian Linux
  - Fedora Linux
  - ...


- Digipeating details of non-APRS UI protocols?  Some way to
  handle "WIDEn-N" on selected PIDs?
- OpenTRAC support ?  (UI, PID=0x77)
  - Yes, on DIGIPEATER ONLY - what about WIDEn-N ? Y/N ?

- "<interface> serial-device ... KISS .." to support more
  esoteric polling modes

- Windows port?
  - AGWPE interface for Windows ?
  - BPQ32 interface ?

- Tx-IGate filter rules (igate.c)

- Colorize debug printout (or make another tool to colorize aprx-rf.log)
    - rx-packets green (or blue), tx-packets red
    - port names/callsigns bolded, same with packet source callsigns

- Beacon definitions inside <interface> definitions?
  They would be sent only to that interface (and to APRSIS)

- Use internal APRS packet parser to validate beacon configurations.
  This should be able to flag bad input on RAW beacon data.

- Special treatment of viscous fill-in digi?
   - tx when:  seen==0, delayed_seen == 1, (seen_transmitter == 1)
   - optionally tx only when seeing first transmit of the request,
     not on any latter ones.

- Calculate and note APRS DXes (like digi_ned does) ?
- Calculate ALOHA range, and publish it?


BoB:
	Shucks, it would sure be nice if EVERY DIGIPEATER also had a
	little smarts and could also report on its own RSSI.

	That would give some people a clue what the digipeater is
	hearing on its input.  In its 10 minute beacon it could report:

		"176RX, 109TX, 243 busy"

	ON a ten minute basis (total 600 1 sec slots) this tells us that
	176 packets were decoded at this site, 109 were elegible for
	further digipeating, and another 243 seconds the channel was
	busy with other collisions and non decodable traffic.  Leaving
	72 secnds the channel was clear.
