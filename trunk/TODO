		     APRX   1.94

		  	TODO

- system integration bits, like init-scripts..
  - Debian Linux
  - Fedora Linux
  - ...

- OpenTRAC support ?  (UI, PID=0x77)
  - Yes, on DIGIPEATER ONLY - what about WIDEn-N ? Y/N ?

- Digipeating details of non-APRS UI protocols?  Some way to
  handle "WIDEn-N" on selected PIDs?

- "<interface> serial-device ... KISS .." to support more
  esoteric polling modes

- Windows port?
  - AGWPE interface for Windows ?
  - BPQ32 interface ?

- Tx-IGate filter rules (igate.c)
- Proper area filters for digipeat (digipeater.c, filter.c)

- bidirectional relaying capability with areal filters ??

- Colorize debug printout (or make another tool to colorize aprx-rf.log)
    - rx-packets green (or blue), tx-packets red
    - port names/callsigns bolded, same with packet source callsigns

- Beacon definitions inside <interface> definitions?
  They would be sent only to that interface (and to APRSIS)

- Use internal APRS packet parser to validate beacon configurations.
  This should be able to flag bad input on RAW beacon data.

- Special treatment of viscous fill-in digi?
   - tx when:  seen==0, delayed_seen == 1, (seen_transmitter == 1)
   - optionally tx only when seeing first transmit of the request,
     not on any latter ones.
