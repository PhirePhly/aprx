		     APRX   v0.08

		  	TODO

- config file reading
   - Mostly done,  serialport additional parameters etc. need work

- manual (man-page draft there is)

- configure -script

- "make install"

- Understand more KISS protocol variants, the CRC-details, port polling ?

- Support AX.25 via Linux kernel, if running on such a system
   -- Mostly completed (netax25.c)
   -- add a filter to permit only listed AX.25 interfaces to
      be relayed into APRS-IS ?

- improved detection of connectivity failure with APRS-IS ?
  (heartbeat monitor does work with javAPRSSrvr, but not with some others)

- bidirectional relaying capability with areal filters ??
  (that would make this a full-blown aprsd / aprsdigi replacement..)

- sync Erlang monitor time intervals to wall clock
  - done  (presuming system clock is in sync)
  - reports also number of packets (done)
  - report calculated erlang value taking the true duration of the first
    frame into consideration (done)
  - let erlang data to be polled via a "http" server
    (erlang accumulation has been placed into its own server to help this)
  - erlang-data is stored on /tmp/aprx-erlang.dat  backing store, add tool
    to make:
     - SNMP polling
     - 1m/10m/60m erlang data extract via HTTP/XML


- Properly process heard RF 3rd-party packets
   - Discard them all ?  (CURRENT BEHAVIOUR)
     ( http://www.aprs-is.net/ISPaths.htm )
   - Open up 3rd party header, and check if gating is OK ?
     ( http://www.aprs-is.net/gatecriteria.htm )

- Logs:
   - rf.log   - packets received from radio, ERLANG10/60 data 
   - aprx.log - network connects/disconnects
