Description: A receive-only APRS igate
 Aprx is a receive-only (ie. RF to NET only) APRS igate.
 It supports multiple KISS-TNCs on serial ports  and listening 
 to any kernel ax.25 network interfaces.
 .
 Additional features include a built-in "erlang-monitor" to analyze
 activity level of radio channels.
 .
 This software requires a valid (and unique) ham radio callsign to
 operate fully and is therefore useful mainly for licensed radio
 amateurs.
