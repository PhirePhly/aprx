		ARPSG-NG    v0.01

A receive-only APRS-IS "i-gate" with following properties:

   CONFIGURATION IS PARTIALLY HARD-CODED INTO  config.c  FILE;
   Config file  /etc/aprsg-ng.conf  IS MOSTLY READ.

   - Is receive-only

   - Can receive data from multiple receivers/modems on local machine
     serial ports

   - Understands:
       - several KISS protocol variants, plain basic KISS preferred
       - TNC2 debug style text  (incomplete)
       - and even AEA "monitor 1" format (incomplete)

   - Connects with one  callsign-ssid  pair to APRS-IS core for all
     received radio ports

   - Knows that messages with following tokens in VIA fields of the
     path are not to be relayed into network:
              RFONLY, NOGATE

   - Knows that following source address prefixes are bogus and thus
     to be junked:
              WIDE, RELAY, TRACE


   - Does not require machine to have AX.25 protocol support internally!
   - Does not use internal AX.25 protocol support! (TODO)
