.SH NAME
.B aprx
\- A receive-only APRS iGate application,
.B "UNDER WORK"
.SH SYNOPSIS
aprx [\-d[\-d]] [\-e] [\-v] [\-l syslogfacility] [\-f /etc/aprx.conf]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B aprx
is a
.I receive-only
APRS iGate application with minimum system support technology requirements.
.PP
.IP \(bu 3
Can listen KISS-TNCs on ordinary serial ports (real ones, or USB ones, all
work as long as they respond to normal UNIX serial port ioctl()s.)
Maximum number of separate serial ports used for radio modem communication
is 16, limit is easy to increase in source code.
.IP \(bu 3
On Linux machine with kernel internal AX.25 protocol support, does want to
listen on it with promiscuous mode, and in order to use that, must be started
as
.I root
user.
The AX.25 socket listening is
.I not
configurable, it is always on in Linux systems.
.IP \(bu 3
Does not require machine to have AX.25 protocol support internally!
(Thus this works also on e.g. BSD machines without PF\_AX25 sockets.)
.IP \(bu 3
Does not require machine to have any other software in it, than things in libc.
In particular no special AX.25 libraries at all, nor widgets or even C++ runtime.
.IP \(bu 3
Connects with one callsign-ssid pair to APRS-IS core for all received radio
ports.
.IP \(bu 3
Knows that messages with following tokens in AX.25 VIA fields are not to be
relayed into APRS-IS network:
.RS 9
.B "RFONLY, NOGATE, TCPIP, TCPXX"
.RE
.IP \(bu 3
Knows that following source address prefixes are bogus and thus messages with
them are to be junked:
.RS 9
.B "WIDE, RELAY, TRACE, TCPIP, TCPXX, NOCALL, N0CALL"
.RE
.IP \(bu 3
Drops all
.I query
messages ("?"), as well as all 3rd party messages ("}").
.IP \(bu 3
Has built-in "Erlang monitor" mechanism, that logs to syslog a interface
specific channel occupancy.   Optionally can log to STDOUT and/or to syslog.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
The
.B aprx
has following runtime options:
.TP
.B "\-d"
Turn on verbose debugging, outputs data to STDOUT.
.TP
.B "\-dd"
the "more debug" mode shows also details of network interaction with
the APRS-IS network service.
.TP
.B "\-e"
.I "Erlang output"
prints 10 minute and 60 minute traffic accumulation byte counts, and guestimates
on channel occupancy, alias "Erlang".
These outputs are sent to STDOUT, which system operator may choose to log elsewere.
This is independent if the "\-l" option below.
.TP
.B "\-l logfacilityname"
Defines
.RB syslog (3)
facility code used by the erlang reporter by defining its name.
Default value is:
.BR NONE ,
and accepted values are:
.BR LOG_DAEMON ,
.BR LOG_FTP ,
.BR LOG_LPR ,
.BR LOG_MAIL ,
.BR LOG_NEWS ,
.BR LOG_USER ,
.BR LOG_UUCP ,
.BR LOG_LOCAL0 ,
.BR LOG_LOCAL1 ,
.BR LOG_LOCAL2 ,
.BR LOG_LOCAL3 ,
.BR LOG_LOCAL4 ,
.BR LOG_LOCAL5 ,
.BR LOG_LOCAL6 ,
.BR LOG_LOCAL7 .
That list is subject to actual facility code set in the system,
and in any case if you specify a code that is not known, then the program
will complain during the startup, and report it.
This is independent of the "\-e" option above.
.TP
.B "\-v"
Verbose logging of received traffic to STDOUT.
Lines begin with reception timestamp (UNIX time_t seconds), then TAB,
and either data as is, or with prefix byte: "*" for "discarded due to data content",
or possibly "#" for "discarded due to APRS-IS being unreachable".
.TP
.B "\-f /etc/aprx.conf"
Configuration file, given path is built-in default, and can be overridden by the program runner.
.PP
Use parameter set 
.B "\-ddv"
to test new configuration by running it synchronously to console.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
The configuration file is used to setup the program to do its job.
Some configurations can be done without the file, namely a channel
.I "Erlang monitor"
siphoning APRS packets off the Linux kernel AX.25 network stack.
.PP
.PP
On the configuration file, following additional notes
.IP \(bu 2
Most parameters are singletons, that is, there can be only one.
.IP \(bu 2
There can be up to (by default) 16 entries of "serialport".
.IP \(bu 2
There can be unlimited number of "netbeacon" lines.
.IP \(bu 2
There can be unlimited number of "ax25-filter" lines.
.IP \(bu 2
There can be unlimited number of "ax25-rxport" lines.
.PP
The configuration file is read upon program start, ever latter.

#mycall           N0CALL\-1

# APRS-IS server name and portnumber.
# Every reconnect does re\-resolve the name to IP address.
# There can be up to 4 system definitions without code modification,

.PP
In the configuration file there is special treatment for quoted strings.
They are stripped of the outer quotes, and "\fC\\\fR" character is processed within
the source string to produce an output string.
The escapes are:
.TP
.B "\fC\\\\n"
Produces newline character (Control-J) on the output string.
.TP
.B "\fC\\\\r"
Produces carriage return character (Control-M) on the output string.
.TP
.B "\fC\\\\\\\\"
Places a back-slash on the output string.
.TP
.B "\fC\\\\""
Places  a double-quote on the output string.
.TP
.B "\fC\\\\'"
Places a single-quote on the output string.
.TP
.B "\fC\\\\xHH"
Lower-case "x" precedes two hex digits which ensemble is then converted to a single byte in the output string.
.PP
The complex encodings are for possible init-strings of the external devices,
.I "however: a nul byte is not possible to produce as it terminates a string!"
( = "\fC\\x00\fR" )
.PP
A configuration token without surrounding quotes does not understand the backslash escapes.


.SH NOTES: ERLANG
The
.I Erlang
is telecom measurement of channel occupancy, and in this application sense
it does tell how much traffic there is on the radio channel.
.PP
Most radio transmitters are not aware of all transmitters on channel,
and thus there can happen a collision causing loss of both messages.
The higher the channel activity, the more likely that collision is.
For further details, refer to statistical mathematics books, or perhaps
on Wikipedia.
.PP
In order to measure channel activity, the
.B aprx
program suite has these built-in statistics counter and summary estimators.
.PP
The
.I Erlag
value that the estimators present are likely somewhat
.I underestimating
the true channel occupancy simply because it calculates estimate of channel
bit transmit rate, and thus a per-minute character capacity.
It does not know true frequency of bit-stuffing events of the HDLC framing,
nor each transmitter pre- and port frame PTT times. The transmitters need to
stabilize their transmit oscillators in many cases, which may take up to
around 500 ms!
The counters are not aware of this preamble-, nor postamble-times.
.PP
The HDLC bit stuffing ratio is guessed to be 8.2 bits for each 8 bits of payload.

.SH NOTES: PROGRAM NAME
Initially this program had name
.IR aprsg-ng ,
which was same as another (less low-tech C++ approach) had.

.SH BUGS
The
.IR Erlang -monitor
mechanisms are of rudimentary quality, and can seriously underestimate the channel occupancy.
