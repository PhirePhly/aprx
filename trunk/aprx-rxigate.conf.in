#
# Minimal sample configuration file for the APRX-2 as Rx-only iGate.
#
# This configuration is structured with Apache HTTPD style tags
# which then contain subsystem parameters.
#

#
# For simple case, you need to adjust 4 things:
#   - Mycall parameter
#   - Select correct type of interface (ax25-device or serial-device)
#   - Optionally set a beacon telling where this system is
#   - Optionally enable digipeater with or without tx-igate
#

#
# Define the parameters in following order:
#   1)  mycall
#   2)  <aprsis>     ** one
#   3)  <logging>    ** one
#   4)  <interface>  ** possibly multiple for each of radio receivers
#

#
# Global macro for simplified callsign definition:
# Usable for 99+% of cases.
#

mycall  N0CALL-1

<aprsis>
#login     OTHERCALL-7	# login defaults to $mycall

# APRS-IS server name and optional portnumber.
# Default port is 14580, and it should be enough for you.

<logging>

# rflog defines a rotatable file into which all RF-received packets
# are logged.  The host system can rotate it at any time without
# need to signal the aprx that the file has been moved.
#
# rflog @VARLOG@/aprx-rf.log

# aprxlog defines a rotatable file into which most important 
# events on APRS-IS connection are logged, namely connects and
# disconnects.  The host system can rotate it at any time without
# need to signal the aprx that the file has been moved.

# ax25-device  Lists AX.25 ports by their callsigns that in Linux
#              systems receive APRS packets.  If none are defined,
#              or the system is not Linux, the AX.25 network receiver
#              is not enabled.  Used technologies need at least
#              Linux kernel 2.4.x
#
# tx-ok        Boolean telling if this device is able to transmit.
