          INSTALL of  APRX v0.09

A rough-cut version of the installation instructions

  1) possibly adjust  Makefile

  2) Cleanliness is good start:

         $ make clean

  3) There is automatic "install" as:

        # make install

      with several presumptions about directories
      fixed into the Makefile (possibly adjustments
      are required.)

  4) Edit the configuration file to match your system:

        # emacs /etc/aprx.conf

     See the  aprx(8) man-page for more info (man 8 aprx)

  5) Starting the program requires manual job, init-script
     has not been written for it yet!
     (trivialish, but not with development priority)

  6) Collect Erlang data, and analyze it..
