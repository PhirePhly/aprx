          INSTALL of  APRX 0.16

A rough-cut version of the installation instructions

  1) possibly adjust  Makefile  or perhaps just
     define overrider values for "make" command

  2) Cleanliness is good start:

         $ make clean

  3) Compile the thing:

         $ make

  4) There is automatic "install" as:

         # make install

      with several presumptions about directories
      fixed into the Makefile (possibly adjustments
      are required.)

  5) Edit the configuration file to match your system:

        # emacs /etc/aprx.conf

     See the  aprx(8) man-page for more info (man 8 aprx)

  6) Starting the program requires manual job, init-script
     has not been written for it yet!
     (trivialish, but not with development priority)

  7) Collect Erlang data, and analyze it using
     the  aprx-stat(8)  utility...
