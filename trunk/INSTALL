          INSTALL of  APRX 1.98

A rough-cut version of the installation instructions

  0) Prerequisites:
      Does not need anything beside standard libc!
      (In particular the Linux version does not need
       libax25 / libax25-dev !)

  1) Start with  ./configure  --parameters
     For a small memory system without writable /tmp
     you have to use  --with-embedded   option.

  2) Cleanliness is good start:

         $ make clean

  3) Compile the thing:

         $ make

  4) There is automatic "install" as:

         # make install

      with several presumptions about directories fixed
      into the Makefile (possibly some adjustments are
      required, depending upon your environment.)

  5) Edit the configuration file to match your system:

        # emacs /etc/aprx.conf

     See the  aprx(8) man-page for more info (man 8 aprx)

  6) Program startup scripts ("init-scripts") exist for
     couple system environments, others may need manual
     adapting.


Things are even simpler for Debian users wanting to compile themselves
instead of using precompiled binaries:

     $ make make-deb

     # dpkg -i aprx_1.98-....deb


For RedHat/Fedora users:


    $ make make-rpm

    # rpm -Uvh aprx-1.98.svn###-1.i386.rpm
