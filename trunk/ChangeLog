	* aprsg.8, erlang.c, aprsg.c, netax25.c, ttyreader.c:
	    Erlang logging now uses syslog(3), unless explicitely told to use
	    output to stdout.  Also the Erlang log format was altered a bit,
	    now it reports also number of packets in the interval.

	* erlang.c, Makefile:
	    "make ERLANG1=1" compiles in also 1 minute erlang logging interval.

	* aprsis.c:
	    Code refactored to put the APRS-IS communication into its own
	    fork()ed sub-process communicating via a socketpair() with the
	    main loop.   Now reconnection time with the APRS-IS server does
	    not affect functionality of the main loop.
