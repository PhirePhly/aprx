	* digipeater.c, interface.c, telemetry.c, aprx.h, ttyreader.c,
	  erlang.c:
	    Start transmitting digipeated frames to ttyreader's KISS
	    output.  netax25's similar interface is not tested.
	    Changed also the Erlang dataset format, and begun to
	    produce Tx packet counts on telemetry.  Accounting
	    saves also tx byte counts, but they are not reported.

	* aprx.h, interface.c, digipeater.c, pbuf.h, pbuf.c, ax25.c:
	    Pass the UI PID information all the way to interface,
	    where it can be matched against a list of PIDs that will
	    be treated alike APRS in digipeating.
	    Have two modes in digipeating: one with interface (and
	    aliases) as recognized work targets, and other with APRS
	    wide/trace tags in addition to interface (and aliases).

	* aprx.h, ax25.c, interface.c, digipeater.c, aprx.conf.in,
	  aprx-complex.conf.in:
	    - Prefill AX.25 address field formatted ax25callsign
	      field on all <interface> datastructures.  That comes
	      handy when doing TRACE processing.
	    - Put exact "callsigns" of "WIDE", "TRACE", and "RELAY"
	      into system as interface callsign aliases. When they
	      are present in the request path, substitute interface
	      callsign there with H-bit set.
	    - Update aprx.conf samples to how the system can be
	      configured.

2009-10-17  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* aprx.h, digipeater.c, interface.c, pbuf.h, parse_aprs.c:
	    Digipeater preparation, system counts done and requested
	    distribution operations with source specific as well as
	    transmitter specific keywords.

	* aprx.h, ax25.c, interface.c, aprsis.c, pbuf.c, parse_aprs.c:
	    Changed a few "parse failed" returns to "parse OK".
	    Systematic feed of datapacket "with TNC2 line end CRLF pair".

2009-10-16  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* erlang.c, aprx.h, ttyreader.c, netax25.c, igate.c:
	    Clean Erlang accountig API.  Removed unused parameters.

	* interface.c, aprsis.c, igate.c, aprx.h, aprx.c, digipeater.c:
	    Minimal <digipeater> <source> definition parsers.
	    Additionally internal "APRSIS" pseudo-interface.

2009-10-15  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* aprx.h, aprx.c, rfbeacon.c:
	    Add internal "tocall" constant with value "APRX19".
	    That one will track software versions.
	    The 'for' keyword on beacons defaults to $mycall.

	* aprx.h, aprx.c, interface.c, config.c, rfbeacon.c, aprsis.c,
	  ttyreader.c, netbeacon.c:
	    Config machinery redone towards new style.  Rx-IGate
	    works again.  (Old config should work too.)

	* aprx.h, pbuf.c, pbuf.h, interface.c, digipeater.c, aprx.c:
	    Skeletons for pbufs, digipeaters, and their uses in
	    the interface layer.

	* aprsdigi.c, ax25.c, Makefile.in:
	    Remove obsolete placeholder.  Things will be done differently.

	* config.c, rfbeacon.c:
	    The rfbeacon code will be doing all variants of beacons..

	* interface.c, netax25.c, ttyreader.c, aprx.h, ax25.c:
	    interface_transmit_ax25() is able to transmit a fully formed
	    AX.25 header+control+body frame to Linux internal AX.25 network
	    devices as well as to any serial port attached KISS device.
	    Transmission to TNC2 devices is not supported.
	    Code is also very careful on checking the AX.25 frame header
	    structure, and rejecting outright any with invalid header
	    structure (bad continuation flags, bad chars in callsigns,
	    not so careful with SSID byte contents - too many are careless
	    with those :-( )

2009-10-14  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* rfbeacon.c, interface.c, Makefile.in, config.c, aprx.c,
	  aprx.h, aprx.conf.in, aprsis.c, netbeacon.c:
	    Add a stub of rfbeacon.

2009-10-13  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* interface.c, config.c, netax25.c, ttyreader.c, ax25.c,
	  aprx.h, ChangeLog:
	    Feed received AX.25 frames to interface layer for possible
	    digipeat processing.  (Missing: APRSIS originated frames!)

	* interface.c, ttyreader.c, aprx.h, aprx.conf.in, aprx.8.in:
	    Remodelled serial-device definitions into interface layer.
	    Documentation updates to match new system.

2009-10-13  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* aprsis.c, aprx.h, config.c, netbeacon.c, aprx.conf.in,
	  VERSION, README, INSTALL, TODO:
	    <aprsis> interface config with new style entry.
	    More of <interface> definitions.
	    Experiments at aprx.conf.in writing.


	* Makefile.in, aprx.8.in, aprx.conf.in, aprx.h, config.c,
	  filter.c, interface.c, netax25.c, netbeacon.c, pbuf.c,
	  pbuf.h, ttyreader.c:
	    Incremental work on new style of configurations
	    as outlined in the Requirement Specification document.
	    Old style configurations do still work.
	    Serial port initstring is now binary transparent.

2009-10-05  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* VERSION: 1.06

	* netbeacon.c:
	    Complete beacon coordinate validator code, now it
	    can detect invalid input values properly.

	* netax25.c, aprsis.c, ttyreader.c, igate.c, aprx.h:
	    Cleaning gcc -Wall warnings on various platforms,
	    including OpenBSD.

2009-10-01  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* VERSION: 1.05

	* kiss.c, netax25.c, ttyreader.c, aprx.h, ax25.c:
	    Write the SMACK frame with correctly escaped CRC.
	    Fixed also serial-port initstring handling.

2009-09-30  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* VERSION: 1.04

	* netax25.c:
	    When writing AX.25 KISS frame to kernel, try to do it
	    up to 3 times.  Also add some debug statements on
	    ax25-rxport processing.

	* VERSION: 1.03

	* ttyreader.c:
	    Fix on serial port startup - always turn on flows on
	    the port, and explicitely flush the driver level
	    buffers discarding possibly accumulated data.

2009-09-28  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* VERSION:  1.02

	* erlang.c, aprx-stat.c, aprx.h:
	    Remove subport from erlang codes, having "tncid N" on serial
	    port definitions takes care of this kind of things.

	* kiss.c, ttyreader.c, netax25.c, ax25.h:
	    Moved KISS/SMACK encoder to separate module, the CRC16 calculator
	    went there as well.  For each ttyreader sub-tncid there is
	    separately opened KISS-pty channel on Linux systems with given
	    callsign as interface's writer channel.  The  netax25 ax25-port
	    reader does not accept packets with source callsign as any of
	    our ttyreader callsigns.

	* erlang.c:
	    Fix the erlang_find() to really find the interface call.

2009-09-07  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* cellmalloc.c, netax25.c, keyhash.c:
	    Compiling at OS/X found a few odd problems, corrected.

2009-08-30  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* aprx.8.in, aprx.conf.in, config.c, aprx.h, aprx.c, telemetry.c,
	  netax25.c, netbeacon.c, aprsis.c, ttyreader.c, erlang.c, 
	  aprx-stat.c:
	    Rename the "mycall" configuration parameter to "aprsis-login",
	    what it really is being used at.  There is no "mycall", anywhere!

	* dupecheck.c, aprx.h, aprx.c, [dupecheck.h]:
	    Removed dupecheck.h after incorporating it into aprx.h.
	    Added the poll-interfaces to handle housekeeping operations.

	* beacon.c -> netbeacon.c, Makefile.in, aprsis.c, aprx.c, aprx.h:
	    Change file name, and all references therein.
	    A preparation for separate RF beacons.

	* netbeacon.c, aprx.8.in, aprx.conf.in:
	    Add "netbeacon dest APRS via NOGATE ..."  options for configuration.

	* netbeacon.c:
	    Use float math to determine next event times for all beacons
	    for smoother distribution.

2009-08-29  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* Makefile.in, dupecheck.c, dupecheck.h, aprx.c, aprx.h, aprsis.c:
	    Add infrastructure for future:  dupecheck()

	* telemetry.c:
	    Add "NOGATE" on telemetry messages transmitted to APRSIS.

	* igate.c:
	    Deeper look into Rx-IGate specs revealed couple missing details.
	    More bits towards Tx-IGate.

2009-08-23  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* VERSION, INSTALL:
	    Mark version as: 1.00

	* aprx.c:
	    Document '-L' option.

	* aprx.h, aprsis.c, beacon.c, igate.c:
	    New internal API to pass data from  aprx proper, and APRS-IS
	    communicator.  This is able to carry binary (including NUL
	    bytes) data both on received AX.25 address, and frame content.

	* telemetry.c:
	    Change a bit on information texts, and transmit frequency.

	* aprx.conf.in, aprx.8.in:
	    Edit prototype configurations, and documentation

	* aprx.c, aprx.h, igate.c, cellmalloc.h, historydb.h, historydb.c,
	  keyhash.h, keyhash.c, pbuf.h, parse_aprs.c:
	    Preparing infrastructure for TX capable i-gate, and digipeater.

2009-02-10  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* Makefile.in, aprsdigi.c, igate.c, aprx.h, ax25.c, ttyreader.c,
	  netax25.c, aprsis.c:
	    Move rx-igate code to igate.c,and make initial moves to
	    collect information about what to do for tx-igate.

	* PROTOCOLS, TODO, README:
	    Document updates.

2008-12-07  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* aprx.c, aprsis.c, netax25.c, configure.in, ttyreader.c, Makefile.in:
	    Compile testing to get this to work on Solaris 10.
	    Also fixes on PIPE failure handling (correct SIGPIPE ignoring)
	    on platforms other than Linux -- and possibly also for Linux.
	    Now this should drop in to FreeBSD and OS/X as well.

2008-10-28  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* netax25.c, aprx.8.in:
	    Turned upside-down the meaning of  ax25-rxport  config
	    parameter.  There is no longer a wild-card receiving
	    mode in Linux internal AX.25 network receiving.
	    All APRS receiving interface callsigns must be listed
	    explicitely.

	* netax25.c, ttyreader.c, aprx.h:
	    SMACK probe transmits on link that is configured for it.
	    Also offers some debug messages on SMACK activation.

	* beacon.c, ax25.c:
	    Cleaning debug printouts

2008-07-18  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* config.c:
	    Function for validate of callsign input syntax

	* telemetry.c:
	    Please the compiler a bit, increment the telemetry
	    sequence number only after all telemetered interfaces
	    have been reported.

	* aprsis.c:
	    If there is need to reconnect to APRSIS, pick all possible
	    IP addresses for it, and use them all.  Also improved
	    the use of new IP resolver API a bit.

	* ttyreader.c:
	    Explicitely set "KISSSTATE_SYNCHUNT = 0" in enumeration.
	    Memory blocks are created with memset() call clearing them.

	* aprx.h, beacon.c:
	    Compiler pleasing

	* erlang.c:
	    One-off array size handling, resulted in SEGV...

2008-04-11  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* VERSION:
	    0.22:

	* erlang.c:
	    Auto-embed the erlang-dataset if backing-store open fails.

	* ttyreader.c:
	    Mark closed socket as closed.

2008-03-29  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* VERSION:
	    0.21

	* telemetry.c:
	    New "send Erlang data as telemetry packets to APRS-IS"
	    subsystem.

	* aprsis.c:
	    Fix the APRS-IS network login protocol.  There are TWO
	    parameter strings after the "vers" keyword.

	* configure.in, Makefile.in, erlang.c:
	    Support compilation as embedded target.  Then the erlang
	    datasets are not off-loadable to the memory mapped files,
	    rather they are very small in-memory tables.

	* erlang.c, aprx.h, telemetry.c, ax25.c, aprx-stat.c:
	    Support for telemetry sending out info on received packets.

	* beacon.c:
	    Improve input validation.

2008-02-18  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* VERSION: aprx-0.18

	* aprx.8.in, aprx.conf.in, beacon.c:
	    New syntax to define netbeacons.  Also support older methods.

	* config.c:
	    Bug in  config_SKIPTEXT  quoted string termination scanning.

	* netax25.c, aprsis.c, aprx.h:
	    Removing dead code, hooks for future "TNC2 -> AX.25"

	* ttyreader.c:
	    Send received KISS frames to system internal AX.25 network,
	    if host has such (such as Linux)

2008-02-03  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* configure.in, netax25.c,
	    autodetect header <pty.h>, and libutil function openpty().

	* netax25.c, aprx.h, aprx.c:
	    Rearranged  netax25 module initing - to happen _latter_.

	* ttyreader.c, aprx.h, netax25.c:
	    kissencoder() function

	* ttyreader.c, aprx.h, netax25.c:
	    On Linux, use openpty() to create an AX.25pseudo-device on
	    which we then can push AX.25 format packets received from
	    non-AX.25 interfaces.  This will itself also _ignore_ packets
	    received from this created interface.

	* beacon.c:
	    "for" attribute for beacon messages, thus this system
	    can claim to be sending the beacons on behalf of others.

	* ax25.c, aprx.h:
	    parse_ax25addr() function.

	* config.c, aprx.8.in, aprx.conf.in:
	    The mycall parameter must be all uppercase AX.25 valid
	    callsign, and must not be same as any other callsign
	    in system internal AX.25 network.  (This is meaningful
	    only on Linux systems..)

	* Makefile.in:
	    Just some cleanup

2008-01-30  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* aprsis.c:
	    Spotted watchdog doing reconnects every 2 minutes
	    (like it is supposed to be), and realized that
	    it really should not care what the server says,
	    just that server is saying something...

	* erlang.c:
	    A bug in backing-store map protection logic.

	* aprx.c:
	    See if pidfile exists.  If it does and the start
	    is not for foreground, refuse to run if process
	    given in the pidfile does exist.

	* aprx.8.in, config.c, netax25.c, ttyreader.c, aprsis.c,
	  aprx.h, ax25.c, aprx.conf.in, beacon.c:
	    New "callsign" config parameter for "radio serial" ports.
	    messages received from given port are sent out using that
	    callsign.    Revamp the whole config parsing.

	* aprsis.c:
	    Smarter main-loop to aprs-is loop  message pass preparation
	    and usage codes -- pass a struct block as message leader.

	* ttyreader.c, netax25.c, aprsis, ax25.c, beacon.c, aprx.h:
	    Pass explicite parameter towards the APRSIS telling, which
	    callsign (radio receiver) the message came in from.

	* aprx.h, config.c, ttyreader.c, beacon.c:
	    Rework config parameter line parsing.  Just one param is
	    processed by the main config reader loop, any further are
	    tasks of the individual subroutines (ttyreader, beacon)


2008-01-26  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* erlang.c:
	    Properly handle r/o share mapping of the aprx.state erlang
	    dataset.  This mode is used by the  aprx-stat  program.

	* netax25.c, aprx.conf.in, aprx.8.in:
	    For each AX.25 socket received packet, query reception
	    interface address and reformat it to TNC2 format.
	    Use that for reception reports, logs, filters etc.
	    Reason: port names given in /etc/ax25/axports do not
	    persist at all!  Even clean system boot may yield
	    different port names than what the file lists.

	* Version 0.17

	* INSTALL, README:
	    Minor edits

	* configure.in, Makefile.in, debian/rules, rpm/aprx.spec.in,
	  Makefile:
	    A bit more coherency on make system regarding linking.
	    Remove generated  Makefile.  (Keep generated  configure !)

	* config.c, ttyreader.c, aprx.conf.in, aprx.8.in:
	    Call the "serialport"  now with name "radio".
	    (Also old one works, so old config does not break.)

	* aprx.h, netax25.c, ax25.c, ttyreader.c:
	    Pass port name down to tnc2_rxgate() function where
	    it is used in rf.log outputs.  A distributed multi-
	    receiver setup log is somewhat .. odd looking when
	    most receivers get same packet.

	* logrotate.arpx.in:
	    Rotate weekly, and compress immediately.
	    Monthly turned out to be too much for "embedded"
	    OH1GSM-1 system.

2008-01-12  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* configure.in, configure, debian/rules, rpm/aprx.spec.in,
	  rpm/aprx.init, Makefile, config.h.in:
	    More RPM / configure rework.

	* configure.in, configure, Makefile.in, Makefile, config.h.in,
	  install-sh, rpm/aprx.spec.in, debian/rules:
	    Had to add minimalistic  configure  script into system for
	    the RPM multi-target compilation to work. 

	* Makefile, rpm/aprx.spec.in, rpm/aprx.default, rpm/aprx.init:
	    RPM package build framework, including init and logrotate -scripts

2008-01-10  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* version 0.16

	* erlang.c:
	    Make the logged data narrower - to usually fit in 80 char lines.

	* aprx.c:
	    Always close STDIN from reading, and replace it with
	    a file handle opened on /dev/null.
	    When daemoning, close also STDOUT and STDERR, and
	    replace them with handles writing to /dev/null.
	    .. and do it as late as possible.

	* aprx.h, aprx.c, config.c, erlang.c, aprx.8.in, aprx.conf.in,
	  aprx-stat.c:
	    Add (and document) option for logging erlang data on separate
	    file without any runtime options or need to divert stdout
	    or syslog anywhere.

2008-01-08  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* aprx.h, ttyreader.c, erlang.c, netax25.c, aprx-stat.c:
	    When talking with multi-drop KISS, account each TNC
	    separately.

2008-01-07  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* version 0.15

	* erlang.c:
	    Do not double-open the state backingstore file

	* aprsis.c:
	    Remember to close the opened log files.

	* ttyreader.c:
	    Support case of _no_ serialports (reading only via AX.25 net)

	* Makefile, logrotate.aprx.in:
	    Put aprx logs on /var/log/aprx/,  and have monthly rotate.

	* debian/*, Makefile:
	    Debian package building infrastructure

	* aprx.8.in, aprx.conf.in:
	    A bit elaboration on how to add multiple entries of
	    aprsis-server, and  serialport  definitions.

	* aprsis.c, ttyreader.c, aprx.8.in, aprx.conf.in:
	    Remove last vestiges of program having any hardwired limits
	    on number of anything.  There are (of course) lots of
	    parameters that are singletons, but all multiples are
	    now unlimited (within memory limits..)

	* Makefile:
	    "make install"  does install the  CFGFILE (aprx.conf)
	    if it does not have to overwrite the thing.
	    "make dist" is even more interesting beast..

2008-01-06  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* version 0.14

	* ttyreader.c, aprx.conf.in, aprx.8.in:
	    Support TNC2 monitor format on reception.

	* ttyreader.c, aprx.conf.in, aprx.8.in:
	    Overload the "serialport" configuration option with a mechanism
	    to define a IP-literal addressable remote TCP port somewhere
	    with e.g. KISS TNC on it.

2008-01-05  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* Makefile:
	    Radical revisioning, Best Current Practice

	* aprx.c:
	    Write aprx.pid  file in all cases, not only when starting
	    as daemon.

	* version 0.13

	* aprx.h, aprx.c, erlang.c, aprx-stat.c:
	    Modifications on shared memory segment head, stores
	    MYCALL, correct running process PID.

	* INSTALL:
	    Some text fixes

	* aprx-stat.c, aprx.h, erlang.c:
	    Report also server process PID on the SNMP dataset,
	    and time in seconds since it was started.

	* ax25.c:
	    Verify TNC2 format APRS message's FROM>DEST,VIA,VIA:
	    callsigns to be of proper syntax.

	* Makefile, aprx.8, aprx.8.in, aprx-stat.8, aprx-stat.8.in,
	  aprx.conf, aprx.conf.in:
	    Centralized a bit of configuring into Makefile, generating
	    files from *.in versions.

	* aprxpolls.c:
	    Library function used everywhere, part of "eliminate fixed
	    size preallocations" -task.

	* aprsis.c:
	    Debug logging improvements, parent death detection.
	    Preserved MAXAPRSIS setting - of 10 servers.

	* ttyreader.c:
	    Unfix the number of TTYs, now can be as many as one wants.

	* config.c, aprx.c, aprx.h, aprx.conf.in, aprx.8.in:
	    pidfile configuration parameter, and its usage

2008-01-04  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* VERSION, arpx.c, Makefile, aprx.8, aprx.8.in,
	  aprx-stat.8, aprx-stat.8.in:
	    Define system version in VERSION file, have it stamped
	    on programs and packages.

	* config.c:
	    The "aprxlog" and "rflog" parameters were interchanged
	    at some point.

	* aprx.c, aprsis.c, beacon.c:
	    Complain loudly with -d or -v options on, and if the
	    configuration does not set global  mycall  parameter.
	    Do not refuse to run, though!  This is perfectly valid
	    for things like Erlang-monitoring.

2007-12-29  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* version aprx-v0.12

	* PROTOCOLS:
	    Writeup of existing (and planned) protocols that this
	    software uses.

	* ax25.c:
	    Correct processing of 3rd-party frames.
	    Also separate TNC2 formatted frame Rx-igateing rules
	    from AX.25-to-TNC2 format translation routine.

	* ax25.c, beacon.c, aprsis.c:
	    Centralize the APRSIS communication line ending CRLF char pair
	    addition into common code, not distributed all over.

2007-12-25  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* version aprx-v0.11

	* TODO, README:
	    Cleanup

	* config.c, netax25.c, aprx.8, aprx.conf:
	    Config option "ax25-rxport" - Limits acceptance of APRS
	    packets only from listed Linux AX.25 ports.

	* ttyreader.c, aprx.conf, aprx.8:
	    Reworked a bit of the serialport config options.
	    Now initstring, and various KISS modes are configurable

	* erlang.c:
	    Carefull approach on erlang-file opening, if file exists,
	    and is non-zero size, open it only if magics match.

	* config.c:
	    config_SKIPTEXT() terminates all scanned strings with NUL byte,
	    and moves to byte following it, if the termination byte was not
	    a NUL byte originally.

	* aprx-stat.c, aprx-stat.8:
	    Option -t  to show timestamps differently.

	* Makefile, man-to-html.sh:
	    Produce decent format HTML versions of the man-pages.

	* config.c, erlang.c, aprx.8, aprx.conf:
	    Added "erlang-log1min" option to control 1 minute interval
	    Erlang sampling logging behaviour.

	* Makefile:
	    Fix "make install" of man-pages

	* version aprx-v0.10

	* aprx-stat.c, aprx-stat.8, erlang.c, Makefile:
	    Statistics reporter tool.

	* aprsis.c, config.c, aprx.8, aprx.conf:
	    Multiple aprsis-server  config definitions are now
	    supported, and used in round-robin fashion.

	* ax25.c, config.c, aprx.8, aprx.conf:
	    Config option  ax25-filter

	* ttyreader.c, erlang.c:
	    Magic channel capacity constant expressions updated..

2007-12-23  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* aprx.c, aprx.h, aprsis.c, aprx.8, aprx.conf, ax25.c, erlang.c:
	    Multiple configuration file options, rf-log, and aprx-log -files,
	    related documentation.

	* config.c, aprx.8:
	    Special quoted-string escape processing.

	* version aprx-v0.08

	* erlang.c, aprx.c, aprx.h:
	    Erlang data has now a mmap():ed filesystem based backing-store.
	    Erlang-data can be syslog()ed, and independently of that,
	    it can be printed on STDOUT.  Default syslog facility is "NONE".

	* Great Rename -- the thing is now called:  aprx

2007-12-06  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* aprsg.8, erlang.c, aprsg.c, netax25.c, ttyreader.c:
	    Erlang logging now uses syslog(3), unless explicitely told to use
	    output to stdout.  Also the Erlang log format was altered a bit,
	    now it reports also number of packets in the interval.

	* erlang.c, Makefile:
	    "make ERLANG1=1" compiles in also 1 minute erlang logging interval.

	* aprsis.c:
	    Code refactored to put the APRS-IS communication into its own
	    fork()ed sub-process communicating via a socketpair() with the
	    main loop.   Now reconnection time with the APRS-IS server does
	    not affect functionality of the main loop.

2007-12-05  Matti Aarnio - OH2MQK - KP20NG  <oh2mqk@sral.fi>

	* ChangeLog
	   Opened for the first time.  Version 0.06.
